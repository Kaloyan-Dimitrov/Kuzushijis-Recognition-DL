# Kuzushijis Recognition Project
## Overview
The Kuzushijis Recognition Project is an ambitious effort aimed at unveiling a millennium of Japanese culture through the digitization and interpretation of Kuzushiji script. Using advanced machine learning and image processing techniques, this project seeks to make ancient Japanese texts accessible to scholars and enthusiasts worldwide. The project is currently in progress and not yet complete.

## Project Status
Please note: This project is currently under development and not all functionalities are implemented yet. We are actively working on adding more features and improving the current methodologies.

## Motivation
Historical texts are invaluable resources that offer deep insights into the cultural, social, and political landscapes of past civilizations. The Kuzushiji script, with its rich historical significance, represents a vast repository of Japanese heritage that remains largely untapped due to the complexity of its interpretation. Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a tool capable of recognizing and translating Kuzushiji script into modern Japanese, thus opening the door to thousands of documents that have been unread and unappreciated.

## Dataset
The initial phase of the project involves working with a dataset containing segmented labels of Japanese texts. The data, stored in a CSV file, includes information such as image IDs and segmented labels detailing the unicode character, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width, and height for each object found in the images.

## Current Progress
- Data Preparation: We have initiated the process of reading and processing the dataset to prepare it for further analysis.
- Image Processing: Preliminary steps have been taken to explore image manipulation techniques required for the recognition process.
## How to Get Involved
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in advancing the project. Whether you are a data scientist, a historian with knowledge of Japanese culture, or simply someone passionate about preserving historical documents, your input can make a difference.

##Future Plans
- Complete the data preprocessing and augmentation steps.
- Develop and train a machine learning model for character recognition.
- Implement a translation feature to convert recognized characters into modern Japanese.
## Installation and Usage
The project is still in the early stages of development, and detailed instructions for installation and usage will be provided as more components are completed.

## Contributing
Your contributions are crucial to the success of this project. If you wish to contribute, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. We are particularly interested in expertise in machine learning, image processing, and Japanese linguistics.
